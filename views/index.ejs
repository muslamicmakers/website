                <p>Ultimately our goal is to help grow the Muslim tech startup community, nurturing more confidence and impact in the startup scene. To help diversify the startup world whilst also encouraging more Muslims to work in diverse environments being proud of who they are and respecting other peopleâ€™s views. Muslamic Makers is not just for Muslims, anyone can come along to any of our events and we encourage it to help build more dialogue and generally develop more awesome things in tech and business.</p>
